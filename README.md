# Site Reliability Engineering

### What is this?

After learning many different things about SRE and gathering some experience in the industry, I felt like it would be a good idea to create a repository to centralize knowledge and summaries about it so that this information can be easily found while facing day-to-day problems. This is also an opportunity to share my understanding and point of view, aiming at giving back to the community and helping others whenever possible :)

### Status

This repository is WIP and I am still figuring out how to organize it (and if it even makes any sense)
